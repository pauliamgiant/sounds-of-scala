## Building


Building requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. 

Run sbt

    $ sbt

Once in sbt you will see the self explaining [SBT Welcome](https://github.com/reibitto/sbt-welcome) menu with shortcuts for common commands. 

Start by entering ```f``` which is a shortcut for ```~fastOptJS / webpack``` and will build and compile to javascript.

    sbt:sounds-of-scala> f

Once this has completed [click here](http://localhost:63342/sounds-of-scala/index.html?_ijt=3t0bdj8qmmfh26b84rp3remja&_ij_reload=RELOAD_ON_SAVE) or locate the index.html file in the root folder and open with your browser.
